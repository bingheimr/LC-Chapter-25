<!-- The 'action' and 'method' attributes allows us to choose where the form 
    request will be sent and what type of request will be sent. How do we 
    configure what happens in response to a form submission?

    Form handlers are web server actions that receive, inspect, and process requests. 
    They then send a response to the client. 
    For this unit we are going to use form handlers that have already been created for us. -->  

    <!-- EXAMPLE: When submitted, this form will send a POST request to the form handler defined by the action attribute. -->

<form action="https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/request-parrot" method="POST">
   <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   <label>Team Name <input type="text" name="team"></label>
   <button>Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- WARNING: Using POST for form submissions adds a very low level of security. 
    Using HTTPS instead of HTTP adds a higher level of security. 
    
    Configuring HTTPS is beyond the scope of this class.-->
