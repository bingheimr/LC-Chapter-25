<!-- POST Form Submission
Instead of using GET and query parameters to submit form data, we can 
use POST. 

To submit a form using a POST request, set the form's 'method'
attribute to "POST". 

Form data submitted via POST will be submitted in
the body of the HTTP request. 

Data submitted by GET requests is less 
secure than POST because GET request URLs and the query parameters are 
cached and logged, possibly leaking sensitive data.
-->

<!-- EXAMPLE: Form with method="POST" -->

<form action="" method="POST">
    <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
    <label>Team Name <input type="text" name="team"></label>
    <button>Submit</button>
 </form>
