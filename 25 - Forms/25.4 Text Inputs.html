<!-- As you know from interacting with web forms, it's possible to use more 
    than simple text inputs. There are additional input types, each with 
    different uses. 
    
    Many of the elements are '<input>' tags with a different 
    'type' value, however some have entirely different tag names. -->

<!-- To start, here are three types of text inputs. These input types can contain text of any value. -->

<!-- Type	        Syntax	                                            Description	
     text	    <input type="text" name="username"/>	            A single line text field.

     textarea	<textarea name="missionDescription"></textarea>	    A larger, multi-line text box. Must have open and closing tags.	

     password	<input type="password" name="passCode"/>	        A text field that obscures the text typed by the user.	
 -->

 <!-- NOTE: Form inputs will NOT look exactly the same in all browsers. 
    However, the inputs should function the same way. Use https://caniuse.com, 
    if there is ever a question of browser support for a certain feature. -->
