<!-- When a form is submitted a key-value pair is created for each 
    named input. The keys are the values of the name attributes, and 
    they are paired with the content of the value attributes. -->

    <!-- Form with two named inputs: -->

<form action="">
   <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   <label>Team Name <input type="text" name="team"></label>
   <button>Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- When this form is submitted with the values from the previous example, the 'query string' looks like this:

username=bingheimr&team=Team+Force

-->
