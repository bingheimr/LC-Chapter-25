<!-- A form submission is triggered by clicking a button inside the form. 

    A submit button can be an input element with type=submit or a button element. 
    
    Both button types are in the below example. -->
<body>
    <p>Example 1</p>
<form>
   <label>Username <input type="text" name="username"></label>
   <!-- clicking either of these will cause a form submission -->
   <p>Two button examples.</p>
   <input type="submit"/>
   <button>Submit</button>
</form>
</body>

<!-- When a form is submitted, an HTTP request is sent to the location set in the 'action' attribute of the '<form>' tag.

If the 'action' attribute is not present or is empty, then the form will submit to the URL of the current page. -->

<!-- The web address is the same as the form we loaded, but now includes a query parameter for every input, 
    with a name, in the form. These parameters are known as the query string parameters. The form values 
    are submitted via the query string because the default submission type for forms is GET. In the next 
    section, we will soon learn how to submit form data via POST. -->
